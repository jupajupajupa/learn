<!-- 1. Topic sentence(s) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: orient the learner to the area covered in this module

    Heading: none

    Example: "Azure Logic Apps let you automate your business processes and run them in the cloud."

    Recommended: visual like an image, table, list, etc. that supports the topic sentence(s)

    [Introduction unit guidance](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-introductions?branch=main#rule-use-the-standard-module-introduction-format)
-->

Microsoft identity platform helps you build applications your users and customers can sign in to. Users can sign in using accounts provisioned through Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

<!-- 2. Scenario -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: describe the real-world scenario this module will use to illustrate the concepts

    Heading: "## Example scenario"

    Example: "Suppose you work at an athletic shoe company on the marketing team. You're launching a new basketball shoe created by a celebrity athlete. Previous launches resulted in a social media frenzy as people shared stories and photos of themselves wearing their new shoes. The marketing team wants to monitor hundreds of social media sites, blogs, and websites to determine consumer reaction. There will be more data than you can process manually. You would like a cloud-hosted system that automates monitoring, text analytics, database storage, and email notifications."

    Recommended: an image that visualizes the scenario, use the image markdown extension (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/markdown-reference?branch=main#images)

    Optional: a "scenario video" that visualizes the scenario

    [Scenario video guidance](TBD)
 -->
## Example scenario

Suppose you work at a banking company as a developer. Your company is looking to develop a web application to help customers access services and information. These services range from checking their account balances, making transactions and applying for loans. To ensure these services are accessed in a secure way, users need to authenticate before they can access these resources. Your company uses Python Django as the web framework to build its web apps. You've been tasked with the responsibility of building a mechanism to authenticate users before they can access these resources.

<!-- 3. Prose table-of-contents --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: List the activities the learner will do in this content. This differs from the title and the learning objectives. The title and the learning objectives are "outcome focused"; that is, they describe the skills the learner will acquire as a result of consuming this content. By contrast, here you should be specific about what the learning will **do** in order to acquire those skills. The format can be either prose or bulleted-list; however, a list will yield better results when transformed into other output types such as PowerPoint.

    Heading: "## What will we be doing?"

    Example: "Here, you'll create a business workflow using Azure Logic Apps to automate the processing of tweets:
                * **Launch**: when a new tweet is available
                * **Process**: determine if the sentiment of the tweet is positive or negative
                * **Route**: branch based on the sentiment score"

 -->
## What will we be doing?

In this module. you'll create a Django web app that authenticates users using Azure AD:

- Register a Django web application in an Azure AD tenant.
- Configure a Django web application to use its tenant registration details.
- Sign in users to a Django web app using Azure AD.

<!-- 4. Terminal learning objective ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Goal: This is a restatement of the module title into a complete sentence. You have more room here to convey the main goal than in a space-limited title. Make it outcome-focused so it describes the main skill the learner will acquire as a result of this training. In other words, it should answer the question: "what is the key thing the learner will be able to do as a result of consuming this training?"

    Heading: "## What is the main goal?"

    Example: "By the end of this session, you'll be able to create workflows which route and process data using Azure Logic Apps and its built-in connectors."

 -->
## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to register a Django web application in an Azure AD tenant and sign in users to the Django web app using Azure AD.
